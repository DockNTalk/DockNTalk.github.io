Language exists since before the homo sapiens and is used by other species besides our own, but focussing on ours for now, there is an ever growing number of languages being created and studied every day.

One of the special characteristics with humans lies on how our brain evolved to understand abstract concepts to the point of allowing to consciously push languages forward.

Not only that, but the interest and even pleasure some people have with the subject led to the creation of completely artificial human languages.

At some point in history there was even discussions about some languages being superior to others. In a form of encoded prejudice, some used to believe that whole civilisations were inferior to others just because of characteristics of their languages.

Hopefully that time is past and it is understood that all languages are equally expressive and not linked to the intellectual capacity of their speakers.

When we look at the IT industry and specially at Computer Science, where you could initially expect to find technical minds, open to learning, some more than others, what you actually find is just the same as in any other human group.

In general, scientists are just a small parcel of the population and only a fraction of it would fit the stereotype that usually comes attached to the word.

Although there are many courses around the world called Computer Science, the title won't make anyone a scientist.

So here things get interesting in my opinion. There are similar discussions and beliefs about language superiority and respective user's intellect for programming as there used to be for traditional languages.

What most lack is knowledge outside their own scope to understand that the matter is much more complex than just defining a grammar. It has from socioeconomic to psychological influences, lots of them...

Maybe the device you believe you choose to buy and are using to read this right now, or the programming language you love and use every day at work and other decisions you made in your life are the result of work, made consciously or not, to benefit from some behavioral mechanisms and take you to such choices.

So, with this first post I wanted to lay the groundwork for many others, to start the discussion that will help shaping the next ones and maybe help people to understand their options, their choices and the ones where made for them, for the good or bad.

Each paragraph could (eventually will) be detailed into separate posts, navigating deeper into the waters between humans and computers, exploring from psychological aspects to specific syntax features while keeping it light in chunks of around 2 minutes reading time, which I hope could make you interested enough to share some comment or feedback.

Cheers,
